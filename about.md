My name is Angel Alonso-Parrizas and I am a security researcher since 2005. During my professional career I have worked in different security roles across different countries, for private corporations, Governs and Universities.  Among all the differente positions in the private sector, I have worked at major telecommunication companies (fortune 500) like [Verizon](http://www.verizon.com) and [France Telecom](http://www.orange.com) and in major financial companies.
In the public sector, I have worked as a Security Engineer for the regional [Goverment of Valencia - Spain](http://www.gva.es), as a collaborator teacher at [Escola Tecnica Superior de Enginyeria at University of Valencia](http://etse.uv.es) and [Escuela Politecnica Superior of Elche at University of Elche](http://www.umh.es).


I hold a Bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science, a Bachelor's degree in Telematic Engineering (Telecommunication Engineering) from [Escuela Tecnica Superior de Ingenieria at University of Valencia](http://etse.uv.es), a Master in Security and Forensic from [Dublin City University](http://www.dcu.ie), and several professional security certifications, including SANS GSE [GIAC Security Expert](https://www.giac.org/certification/security-expert-gse), GCIH, GCIA, GREM, GMOB, GPPA, GCFA, GSNA, GSEC, GCTI, ISC2 CISSP, ISACA CISM & CISA.
